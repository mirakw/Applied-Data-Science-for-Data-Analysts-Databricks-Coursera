# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC # Linear Regression Coefficients and P-values
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Objective**: *Demonstrate feature importance within linear regression.*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we will complete a series of exercises to show how to examine the P Values from a Linear Regression model.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run "../../Includes/Classroom-Setup"

# MAGIC %md

# MAGIC ## Prepare data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Aggregate our user-level table
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Remember that one of our project objectives is to predict a customer's BMI based on their recorded metrics. Therefore, we are interested in a user-level clustering. To prepare the dataset to do this, we'll aggregate our **`adsda.ht_user_metrics`** table at the user level.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE adsda.ht_user_metrics_lifestyle
# MAGIC USING DELTA LOCATION "/adsda/ht-user-metrics-lifestyle" AS (
# MAGIC   SELECT avg(resting_heartrate) AS avg_resting_heartrate,
# MAGIC          avg(active_heartrate) AS avg_active_heartrate,
# MAGIC          avg(bmi) AS bmi,
# MAGIC          avg(vo2) AS avg_vo2,
# MAGIC          avg(workout_minutes) AS avg_workout_minutes,
# MAGIC          avg(steps) AS steps,
# MAGIC          first(lifestyle) AS lifestyle
# MAGIC   FROM adsda.ht_daily_metrics
# MAGIC   GROUP BY device_id
# MAGIC )

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM adsda.ht_user_metrics_lifestyle

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md

# MAGIC ### Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will use this Pandas DataFrame in this demo.

# COMMAND ----------

ht_lifestyle_pd_df = spark.table("adsda.ht_user_metrics_lifestyle").toPandas()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC View the data

# COMMAND ----------

ht_lifestyle_pd_df.head()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Fitting a Linear Regression Model and Examining Coefficients and P Values
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This process has a few steps so we'll string everything together and explain step by step.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Step 1 - Feature Engineering
# MAGIC Pandas has a built-in method to one-hot encode called `get_dummies()`. We'll use that here to transform the `lifestyle` feature into a numeric feature.

# COMMAND ----------

import pandas as pd

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC We can see that the object we receive back is a new DataFrame. We'll save this out to a variable

# COMMAND ----------

lifestyle_dummies_df = pd.get_dummies(ht_lifestyle_pd_df['lifestyle'])

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Then we'll join this back onto our original dataframe

# COMMAND ----------

ht_lifestyle_pd_df = ht_lifestyle_pd_df.join(lifestyle_dummies_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Finally, we'll drop the original `lifestyle` column because it is now uncessary.

# COMMAND ----------

ht_lifestyle_pd_df.drop('lifestyle', axis=1, inplace=True)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Step #2 - Create feature matrix and target
# MAGIC Now we need to create our X and y from our features and target. Recall that our target is the thing we are trying to predict, BMI, given some features about an observation.

# COMMAND ----------

X = ht_lifestyle_pd_df.drop('bmi', axis=1)
y = ht_lifestyle_pd_df['bmi']

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Step 3 - Fit our model
# MAGIC Import statsmodels.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 🎯Note that the statsmodels api refers to our target variable as the endogenous or dependent variable and our features as the exogenous or independent variable.

# COMMAND ----------

import statsmodels.api as sm

# COMMAND ----------

model = sm.OLS(endog=y, exog=X)
bmi_ols_results = model.fit()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Step 4 - Examine results
# MAGIC Once our model is fit, we have helper methods and attributes available. Of interest to us first are the coefficients. The most robust of all of these is a method called `.summary()`

# COMMAND ----------

bmi_ols_results.summary()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The coefficients of our model are in the middle of the output. It looks like the largest coefficient is our `athlete` column, which if we recall, refers to whether or not a person is an athlete. Intuitively, this makes sense - people who are athletes are likely to have a different BMI than people who are not. We also see some negative coefficients. This does not imply that these features are unwanted or not helpful, it just means that the relationship between the two variables moves in opposite directions. Intuitively, this also makes sense - the more average workout minutes someone has, the lower their BMI is. Put another way: as workout minutes go 👆🏽, BMI goes 👇🏽.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's examine P-Values

# COMMAND ----------

bmi_ols_results.pvalues

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC It looks like all of our features have very low P Values. P-values here are answering the question: what is the probability that a world exists where the coefficient for this is equal to zero (no effect)? Given our P-values can assume that there is a very low probability that these coefficients do not have `no effect`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC To interpret these in the context of `feature importance` is first with coefficients. We can interpret coeffcients as a measure of the importance in our model. Here, our larger coefficients - `Athlete`, for example - can be thought of as being important.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC With P-values, the smaller the value, the more likely our feature has an effect on the target! We can think of this as an impactful feature.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Nicely done!
